# ANL201-Tableau-Dashboard
Fictional Context: This dashboard is created for the newly appointed Education Minister, Mr. David, who wants to see how the number of undergrad enrolment varies across the different states in the United States. He also wants to see how the tuition fees and university ranking differs for the top 3 states with the highest number of undergrad enrolments.
